/* an example -- this allocates a red-black tree for integers.  For a 
 * user-specified number of iterations, it does the following:

 * delete a random element in the tree.
 * make two new random elements, and insert them into the tree
 
 * At the end, it prints the sorted list of elements, and then prints
 * stats of the number of black nodes in any path in the tree, and 
 * the minimum and maximum path lengths.
  
 * Rb_find_ikey and rb_inserti could have been used, but instead
 * rb_find_gkey and rb_insertg were used to show how they work.
