Libtu is a small utility library for programs written in C. 

Most of this library may be distributed and modified under either under
the Clarified Artistic License or the GNU LGPL, version 2.1 or later, 
both reproduced in the file LICENSE. The red-black tree code is under
the GNU LGPL; see README.rb for details.

To build the library, first edit system.mk to customize it for your
system if necessary. Then 'make depend && make'.
To install it run 'make install' (perhaps as root depending on
where you are installing it).

If you want to use it in your programs, you may try to figure out how
by reading the header files (include/*.h) and test programs (tester*.c).
Or you could try urging me to write some sort of a manual.

Libtu needs the functions asprintf and vasprintf. These do not
exist on most platforms. One implementation by Mark Martinec
is included in snprintf_2.2/ and is used by default. To use the
system's versions of these functions, if available, modify
system.mk.

The implementation of red-black trees is based on that by
James S. Plank; see README.rb for details.
