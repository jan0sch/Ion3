Welcome to Ion!

If you have never used Ion before, it is highly recommended that you study 
the Ion manual page before proceeding further. It is reproduced below, but 
you can also access it later on, for example, by pressing <F1> and then 
<Enter> or, by running 'man ion3' in a terminal. All this supposing that 
you have installed Ion in a standard location so that the system commands
can find the manual page.

If you are too eager to try out Ion and against all recommendation want to
skip reading the manual page, you should at least know that pressing <F2> 
should start a terminal emulator (xterm) and that the main menu can be 
accessed with <F12>.

When you feel ready to write customized configuration files (you're going
to do that in any case), please see the configuration manual available from
the Ion webpage listed at the end of the user manual below. It may, however,
be beneficial to become well acquainted with Ion before delving into this 
so that you have grasped the basic concepts necessary to understand the
binding configuration files.
